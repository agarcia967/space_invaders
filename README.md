CS150 C++ Program Space Invaders
Name the game “<your name>_SpaceInvader.cpp”
Write a game program that simulates a spaceship moving back and forth (left right) on the top of the screen and a gun at the bottom that moves left and right with the press of the arrow keys.
Screen layout:
					Space Invader
					By <your name>
**********************************************************************************
              <0>  “ship”
		                  0
			    0
			    0    “shot”
			    0
			    0
			    0
		              *[ 0 ]*    “gun”
**********************************************************************************
Shots:  35
Hits:     25

Your ship should move back and forth across the top of the screen. When it gets to the end should change direction. The gun should only move to the end of the screen and no more. You have to press a different arrow to come back.

Use the following keys to move the gun and fire it:

           Fire gun    ↑
	Left     ←   →   Right
	
Any key should start the game when not running and “Q” to quit.

When the shot hits the ship change the ship to the words “Hit” or something else to let the user know that they have hit the ship.

These are the minimum requirements of the game. You can add anything additional that you may want as long as the minimum requirements are met in some form or fashion.

You will be graded on program working as required, Look of game, visual style “do things move correctly”, is file labeled correctly, coding “are there functions and classes”, and good exit from program at any time.

In other words make it something you are proud of!!!!
